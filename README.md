> **Goal:**  
> Take a messy pile of unlabeled images and automatically organize them into meaningful visual groups — without using a single label — and explore those groups interactively in 3D.

Here I Have Used CIFAR-10 Dataset, it has 10000 images, but i have considered only first 1000 images,

This project demonstrates how **semantic structure can emerge from data alone** by combining deep feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering, packaged as a fast, interactive system.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters


**Insted of Doing Clustering Tabular Data, Static 2D Plots, We can be**
- Working with a **unstructured image data**
- Using a **pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor**
- Separating **modeling**, **visualization**, and **deployment**
- Building an **interactive system**

The result feels closer to a lightweight, unsupervised version of *Google Photos clustering* — but built from first principles.

## 🧩 High-Level Pipeline


```
Raw Images
      ↓
CNN Feature Extraction (MobileNetV2)
      ↓
1280-D Semantic Embeddings
      ↓
PCA (Noise Filtering & Compression)
      ↓
t-SNE (3D Visualization Space)
      ↓
Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means / DBSCAN)
      ↓
Interactive 3D Exploration (Streamlit + Plotly)
```

Each stage is intentionally isolated so the system is:
- **Debuggable**
- **Reproducible**
- **Fast at runtime**

**Design choice:** Heavy computation happens once in notebooks. The Streamlit app only loads artifacts → no recomputation, fast UX.

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions (Engineering Rationale)

### 🔹 Why not cluster raw pixels?

Pixel distances are extremely fragile — a 1-pixel shift completely changes the math.

**Fix:** Use a pre-trained CNN to extract semantic embeddings that encode:
- Texture
- Shape
- Object parts
- Visual context

### 🔹 Why MobileNetV2?

- Lightweight and fast
- Pre-trained on ImageNet
- Excellent trade-off between speed and semantic quality
- Ideal for feature extraction, not classification

### 🔹 Why PCA before t-SNE?

- t-SNE is slow and unstable in very high dimensions
- PCA removes noise and compresses global structure
- PCA acts as a semantic filter, not just a math trick

**PCA is used here as meaning compression, not visualization.**

### 🔹 Why not cluster on t-SNE output?

t-SNE distorts global distances and is not mathematically suitable for clustering.

**Correct approach:**
- Cluster in PCA space
- Visualize in t-SNE space

## 🔍 Clustering Strategy

### K-Means
- Forces a fixed number of clusters
- Useful for testing whether embeddings naturally separate into groups
- Provides stable, interpretable partitions


### DBSCAN
- Density-based clustering
- No need to specify number of clusters
- Naturally detects outliers and ambiguous images

**Using both highlights the difference between:**
- *Forcing structure* vs *discovering structure*

## 🖥️ Interactive Application

![alt text](image.png)

The Streamlit app provides:

✨ 3D interactive visualization (Plotly)  
🎨 Color-coded clusters  
🔍 Hover-based inspection  
🔎 Manual image lookup via ID  
🔄 Toggle between clustering strategies

This turns abstract embeddings into human-interpretable insight.

## ▶️ Running the App Locally


1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [LINK](https://github.com/Shreyas-S-809/Unsupervised-Image-Organizer)
   cd Unsupervised-Image-Organiser
   ```

2. **Initialize and Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```powershell
   # Create environment
   python -m venv en

   # Activate (Windows)
   en\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

All heavy ML computation is already done — the app loads instantly.

## 📌 Possible Extensions

- Swap CIFAR-10 for a custom image dataset
- Add cluster filtering & search
- Introduce a feedback loop for human-in-the-loop refinement
- Replace t-SNE with UMAP for faster scaling
- Deploy with Docker / Hugging Face Spaces
